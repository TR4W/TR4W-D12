  Icom IC-970D -- CI-V address $2E.

  Behaviour comes entirely from TIcomReadLimitedRadio (uRadioIcomReadLimited):
  the full modern Icom profile MINUS the unselected-VFO read ($25/$26) and the
  RIT read, because this model is absent from LOGRADIO's
  IcomRadiosThatSupportVFOB and IcomRadiosThatSupportRIT.  Split ($0F), TX status
  ($1C), the $06 filter byte and the $1A06 data-mode probe all stay -- D7 does
  all four for every Icom except the IC-718.

  Legacy default baud: 9600 (the operator sets this in the CAT dialog; recorded
  here because it is easy to lose once RadioParametersArray retires).

  ****  NOT BENCH-VALIDATED  ****
  If a tester shows this radio deviates, override DefineCapabilities HERE -- never
  add a model test to the shared base.
