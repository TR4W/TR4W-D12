.SYNOPSIS
   Lints Object Pascal source for if/for/while/with bodies that are missing the
   required begin/end block (per the project's coding standard).

.DESCRIPTION
   Flags the high-confidence, unambiguous case: a line that ends with the body
   introducer `then` or `do`, whose next code line is a single statement NOT
   wrapped in `begin`.

   Deliberately conservative to avoid false positives:
     * Only end-of-line `then`/`do` are checked -- single-line forms like
       `if X then Exit;` and `else if Y then DoY` are not flagged (this also
       sidesteps the `if X then Exit;` and dispatch-chain carve-outs).
     * `else` bodies are not checked (can't distinguish if-else from case-else
       line-by-line without a real parser).
     * Bodies that are `begin`, `Exit`, `Continue`, or `Break` are allowed.

   Trailing // and { } / (* *) comments are stripped before the check.

.PARAMETER Path
   One or more Pascal files to lint.

.OUTPUTS
   One line per violation:  <file>:<line>: <message>
   Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = at least one violation (handy for CI).
