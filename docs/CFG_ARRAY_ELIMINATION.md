# Eliminating the CFG array

**Started 2026-09-10.** Directed by NY4I in the same conversation that decided
`SERIAL n` has to go: *"we need to move away from the OS name such as serial N"*,
then *"work on the elimination of the cfg array"*.

This document is the **map and the running status**. It replaces nothing: read
[`CFG_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](CFG_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) for the per-unit detail of the
ini-to-JSON move and [`CFG_COMMAND_TABLE.md`](CFG_COMMAND_TABLE.md) for the radio
row audit. What is new here is the measurement of what the array still **does**,
which turns out not to be what the older documents assume.

---

## 1. The reframe: `csOld` is zero, and the job is not close to done

Every note in `docs/` and in the agent memory tracks progress by counting rows
still marked `csOld` or `csNew`, because those are the rows the operator can
still see in Ctrl-J. **That number is now 0.**

Measured 2026-09-10 over `tr4w/src/uCFG.pas`, live rows only, comments excluded:

| `crS` | rows |
|---|---:|
| `csJSON` | 313 |
| `csOwned` | 94 |
| `csRem` | 84 |
| `csOld` / `csNew` | **0** |

**Reading that as "done" would be the mistake this document exists to prevent.**
`csJSON` means the row's value is *stored* in `settings/tr4w.json` rather than in
`tr4w.ini`. It does **not** mean the row is inert. `CheckCommand` takes an
`aApplyJSONOwned` flag, and the comment at `uCFG.pas:1866` is explicit about why:

> *The inertness exists to stop a STALE INI FILE overriding `settings\tr4w.json`
> … That is a statement about the ini LOADER, not about every caller. A value
> arriving from a trusted source -- the settings screens, or a multi-op peer --
> still has to be APPLIED, and applied through here.*

So Preferences, the multi-op peer sync, and the profile applier all still drive
settings **as text commands through this array**. The store moved. The applier
did not.

**407 live rows still apply.** That, not 0, is the size of the thing.

> It was 408 the day this was written. `ORION PORT` was retired on
> 2026-09-10, and that is the unit of progress here: one row at a time.

## 2. What the array actually is

`CFGCA` is three mechanisms wearing one name. They need different work, so
counting rows without splitting them gives a misleading total.

| how the row reaches its value | rows | what replacing it means |
|---|---:|---|
| `crAddress: @SomeGlobal` | **270** | the value has to live somewhere typed |
| `crAddress: @Config.SomeField` | **71** | already done -- this is the destination |
| `crAddress: pointer(N)`, an index into `ListParamArray` or `ArrayRecordArray` | **66** | a spelling table has to stop being the parser |
| `crAddress: Pointer(7)` with no array | 1 | one oddity, unexamined |

By kind: 342 `ckNormal`, 52 `ckList`, 14 `ckArray`.

**The 71 are the shape everything else is heading for.** A `Config` record field
is reachable by name, typed by the compiler, and needs no text at all. The
remaining 270 are bare globals, and moving one is the five-step operation
recorded in agent memory, two of whose steps are silent data loss when skipped.

---

## 2a. The destination, in NY4I's words

> *"every caller of a parameter in the array should just reference the config
> registry. So rather than reading from json into the registry then setting CFG
> array items to those values callers just access Registry.variable name. That
> way the array can be retired."* -- NY4I, 2026-09-10

So the target is not "move the storage". It is **remove the hop**:

```
   today       JSON  ->  registry  ->  CheckCommand  ->  a global  ->  callers
   target      JSON  ->  registry  ->  callers
```

**THIS OVERRIDES WHAT `uSettingsRegistry`'s OWN HEADER SAYS**, and the header
should be corrected rather than left to contradict the plan. It currently reads:

> *ON THE GLOBALS. This does NOT try to abolish TR4W's global variables; they
> are read from thousands of places and that is a separate, much larger job.
> The registry sits in FRONT of them.*

That was the right scope for building the registry. It is no longer the scope of
the project: the separate, much larger job **is** the job.

### The successor exists, and is UNDER REVIEW rather than settled

**NY4I interrupted the session that built this, deliberately, to review it
(2026-09-10).** So read the table below as *what was built*, not as *what is
agreed*. Nothing in this document depends on it -- the measurements in 1, 2 and
2b are of `uCFG.pas` itself and stand either way -- but the STAGING does: if the
registry's shape changes, the batches in 2b are still the batches, and only
their destination moves.

Work in the 24 hours before this was written, in another session:

| | |
|---|---|
| `uSettingsRegistry` | a setting is a typed getter/setter pair, not an address plus a tag saying how to dereference it |
| the three blocking prerequisites | **closed** -- `ReadOnly` lifts `crJ` 2 and 3, `HasSideEffects` lifts `crP` and `crA`, `Broadcast` lifts `crNetwork` |
| `uTestAllSettings` | walks every real setting, ~1500 assertions, and holds each to the contract a config file and a panel depend on |
| settings actually graduated | **4** -- the QSO-point rows, and they went first because `CFGCA` structurally **could not hold them**: `crMin`/`crMax` are `Word`, so a table row cannot express the -1 those variables legitimately carry |

**That last row is the strongest argument in the whole file.** The table was not
merely inconvenient for those four settings. It could not describe them, and had
been declaring a range its own variables violated.

Note what did NOT happen to those four: their `CFGCA` rows stayed **fully
active**, because a contest `.cfg` sets QSO points and retiring the row would
have left every such contest scoring on -1. **One variable, two writers.** That
is the general case, not an exception, and it is why "retire the row" is a
different decision from "graduate the setting".

## 2b. How big the hop-removal actually is

Measured 2026-09-10: every textual reference under `tr4w/src` to the 270 globals
still on a bare `crAddress`, folded for case, 446 files scanned.

| | |
|---|---|
| total references | **4,663** |
| upper bound, because | it counts the declaration and the `CFGCA` row itself |

**The distribution is the useful part, because it says how to batch this:**

| references to that global | settings |
|---|---:|
| 1 to 5 | **85** |
| 6 to 20 | 117 |
| 21 to 60 | 56 |
| over 60 | 12 |

**Eighty-five settings are nearly free.** Five references or fewer means the
global is read where it is set and almost nowhere else, so moving it is a local
change a test can cover. That is a third of the remaining work available in
small, low-risk batches.

The twelve at the other end are the identity fields, and they are expensive for
an obvious reason:

| setting | global | references | units |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `MY CALL` | `MyCall` | 169 | 32 |
| `MY COUNTRY` | `MyCountry` | 146 | 15 |
| `MY STATE` / `MY QTH` | `MyState` | 146 | 24 |
| `RADIO ONE`/`TWO NAME` | `RadioN.RadioName` | 112 | 15 |
| `CODE SPEED` | `CodeSpeed` | 109 | 17 |
| `MY GRID` | `MyGrid` | 104 | 16 |

**`MY STATE` and `MY QTH` are one variable under two names**, the same shape as
the `ORION PORT` alias just retired -- and this one is already known to be
harder, because QTH is a contest-dependent catch-all rather than a town.
**`CODE SPEED` is not a setting at all** in the sense the others are: it is live
shared state that every keyer mutates during a contest, so it must not be
repointed into a config object without a decision about that.

---

## 2c. The spelling tables

The 66 indexed rows resolve through **54 `ListParamArray` entries over 40
distinct spelling tables**. Two tables carry most of the reuse:

| table | entries |
|---|---:|
| `tr4w_RTSDTRTypeSA` | 8 |
| `PortTypeSA` | 6 |
| `BandStringsArrayWithOutSpaces`, `RadioTypeTokensA` | 2 each |
| the other 36 | 1 each |

**These tables are the second definition problem in its purest form.** A spelling
table is a hand-written array of the text form of an enum, indexed by ordinal,
matched case-insensitively by `TF.GetValueFromArray`. Nothing checks that the
table and the enum agree. The radio work already found what that costs: the
name table was missing `TS140` and carried a `TS530` the enum never had, so a
config saying `TS440` selected the TS-140 driver, for four Kenwoods, for years.

`GetValueFromArray` is also the routine whose pointer walk crashed on Linux in
September, because it computed a stride of 4 for an array of pointers. **Forty
tables reach through that one function**, which is every enumerated config value
the program has.

---

## 3. Stage A -- DONE 2026-09-10

**One rule for turning a configured port into a device name.**

It had been written five times: `ConvertPortTypeToCOMString` in `MainUnit`, and
four bare `Format('COM%d', [Ord(port)])` calls in the radio factory, the CW
keyer, the rotator controller and the WinKeyer. Three of the four carried a
comment naming the other copies.

It is `uPortAddress.SerialDeviceName` now, with an exhaustive pin test over the
enum and a round-trip test against `ComPortEnumerator.ComPortNumber`.

**It found a defect in three of the five.** They guarded with `<> NoPort`, which
a port configured as `NETWORK` satisfies -- ordinal 65, one past `Serial64` --
so the name built was `COM65` and the open went against whatever answered.
`SerialDeviceName` returns `''` for anything that is not serial, and those three
now refuse and log which port kind they were handed.

This is the choke point everything in stage B flows through.

---

## 4. Stage B -- the port rows. PLANNED, NOT STARTED

This is the slice NY4I's `SERIAL n` decision authorises, and it is deliberately
**not** started without review: it touches the profile applier and the radio
open path, which is the most bench-sensitive code in the program and the part
CLAUDE.md is clearest about not trusting to code review.

### What holds it up today

Seven `CFGCA` rows resolve through six `ListParamArray` entries over `PortTypeSA`:

| command | `crS` | variable |
|---|---|---|
| `RADIO ONE CONTROL PORT` | `csOwned` | `Radio1.tCATPortType` |
| `RADIO TWO CONTROL PORT` | `csOwned` | `Radio2.tCATPortType` |
| `KEYER RADIO ONE OUTPUT PORT` | `csOwned` | `Radio1.tKeyerPort` |
| `KEYER RADIO TWO OUTPUT PORT` | `csOwned` | `Radio2.tKeyerPort` |
| `ROTATOR PORT` | `csOwned` | `ActiveRotatorPort` |
| ~~`ORION PORT`~~ | **`csRem` 2026-09-10** | ~~`ActiveRotatorPort`~~ -- retired, see below |
| `WK PORT` | `csJSON` | `WinKeySettings.wksWinKey2Port` |

~~`ORION PORT` and `ROTATOR PORT` are two commands writing one variable.~~
**RULED 2026-09-10.** NY4I: *"Drop Orion port. It covered by the general port
as a type Orion in settings".* It was shorthand for "the rotator is an Orion,
on COM5" -- a second spelling of two other settings, in the same family as
MY QTH being MY STATE -- and its `crA` hook did nothing but set the rotator
type.

It is `csRem`, **not deleted**, and that difference matters to an operator
upgrading from 4.x: a withdrawn row is still RECOGNISED, so an existing `.cfg`
naming it loads inert instead of erroring on every start. Its hook is deleted
and its slot in `AdditionalProcsArray` is `nil` rather than removed, because
that table is positional and dropping an entry would shift every `crA` above
it and repoint twenty-one rows at the wrong hook.

So the port rows are **six**, over five `ListParamArray` entries.

### The chain, and why it has four spellings of one fact

```
   the drop-down          /dev/ttyUSB0   or   COM7      the OS name
   ComNameToPortValue     'SERIAL 7'                    TR4W's own token
   settings/tr4w.json     "controlPort": "SERIAL 7"
   the legacy key text    RADIO ONE CONTROL PORT = SERIAL 7
   PortTypeSA             ordinal 7                     a third spelling
   SerialDeviceName       'COM7'                        the OS name again
   TSerialPort.Create     opens it
```

**Both ends are the OS name.** Everything between is TR4W talking to itself, and
the middle is what cannot be spelled on Linux.

### What the change is

`PortType` conflates three questions. Only the first wants an enumeration.

1. **What kind** -- serial, network, LPT, none. Nearly every call site asks only
   this, through `= NoPort`, `= Network` or `in SerialPorts`.
2. **Which port** -- only the name formatter asks, and this is the part that
   cannot exist off Windows.
3. **A small integer to key an array** -- exactly one table wants this,
   `SerialPortObject: array[TSerialPortRange] of TSerialPort` in the CPU keyer,
   and it wants a dictionary.

So: keep a small kind enum, make the address a string that is the OS name, and
let one table become a dictionary. `TSerialPort` needs no change at all -- it
already takes whatever name it is given, and its own comment already lists
`/dev/ttyUSB0` as a case it expects.

### Compatibility, checked rather than assumed

| question | answer |
|---|---|
| does a port cross the multi-op wire? | **No.** The only reference in the networking units is a commented-out line in `lognet.pas` |
| does a shipped contest `.cfg` carry a port? | **No.** None in `target/dom` |
| what must still be read? | an operator's own `settings/tr4w.json` holding `SERIAL n`. A one-way translation at load, the same read-once pattern `uLegacyIniPrompt` already describes |

There is **no deployed encoding to preserve**. The compatibility surface is one
local file.

### Effort, measured

63 references to the four port globals. Sorted by what they actually need:

- **presence and kind tests** -- the large majority. Untouched by the address change.
- **logging and display** -- four sites reading `PortTypeSA`. Cosmetic.
- **conflict detection** -- one site comparing two radios' ports. Works with any comparable value.
- **the parse** -- the seven rows above.
- **the name formatter** -- one, since stage A.
- **one array indexed by the enum** -- the only structural dependency.

## 5. Open, and needing a ruling

1. ~~**`ORION PORT` and `ROTATOR PORT` write the same variable.**~~ **CLOSED
   2026-09-10** -- dropped. See stage B.
2. **Does the kind stay an enum, or become a property of a port class?** CLAUDE.md
   prefers a class to a record, but `RadioObject` is an old-style `object` held in
   globals, so an object-typed field there is a lifetime question rather than a
   style one.
3. **Which stage the 270 bare globals move in, and in what themed batches.** They
   are the bulk of the work and none of it is urgent; the port slice is urgent
   because it blocks a platform.
4. ~~**Whether `GetValueFromArray` and the 40 spelling tables get a guard now.**~~
   **HALF-CLOSED 2026-09-10.** `Lint-SpellingTables` gates the build and fails
   on a duplicate or blank spelling, which is the part that makes an enum value
   unreachable by name. 39 tables, 685 spellings, clean. The 40th,
   `RadioTypeTokensA`, is filled from the enum by the registry and has nothing
   to check -- which is the shape the other 39 should end up as.

   **What the lint CANNOT check, and no lint can:** that each spelling means
   what its ordinal means. That is the second definition problem itself, and the
   only real fix is generating the table from the enum.

   **It does not duplicate `uTestAllSettings`, and the difference matters.**
   That suite round-trips each setting's *current* value, so it catches a
   shadowed spelling only when a station happens to be sitting on the shadowed
   ordinal. The lint is static and exhaustive over every ordinal in every table,
   including the ~490 settings the registry has not adopted yet.

   It surfaced one thing needing a ruling: **`QSOPointMethodArray` spells
   `ONY` at ordinals 29 and 85.** The second is commented
   `OldNewYearQSOPointMethod` and is the one unreachable; the first carries no
   provenance comment at all. Already noted in `TF.pas`, baselined in the lint,
   and deliberately not touched: which ordinal `ONY` selects decides which
   scoring rule a contest runs under, and the golden corpus is blind to scoring.
