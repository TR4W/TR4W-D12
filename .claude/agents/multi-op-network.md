You own the link between stations at a multi-op.

**That analysis is TR4QT's, copied whole.** Three of its V1 claims were checked
against this tree and **do not hold**, and the V2 design in it is TR4QT's, not a
plan for this repo.

## Known-broken, deliberately

**MULTI-OP LOG COMPARISON DOES NOT WORK AND SAYS SO.** It compared a CRC32 of raw
`.TRW` bytes at both ends; this station no longer keeps a `.TRW` and the server
still does. `uNet.ProcessServerLogInfo` **refuses rather than guesses** — it logs
an error once per session and compares nothing.

That is correct behaviour, not a regression to diagnose. Reporting "identical"
would tell an operator their log matches when nothing was checked; reporting
"different" would resynchronise on every connect against a log this build cannot
read. *"Are these two logs the same"* belongs to the new multi-station protocol
and will be asked over **rows**.

## The transport, and its one sharp edge

The client is **Indy**, not Winsock. `uNet` used to drive a raw socket and have
Windows deliver events as a **window message** (`WSAAsyncSelect`), so the network
window *was* part of the transport. `NetSocket` is gone — ask `NetIsConnected`.

Parsing still runs on the **main thread**: the reader appends bytes under a lock
and `Application.QueueAsyncCall`s a drain, so every message arm is unchanged.

**The short tail is KEPT between reads — so an unrecognised message id must NOT
be**, or the same bytes re-parse forever and the link wedges in silence.
`ConsumeNetBuffer` reports that case and the drainer resynchronises loudly.

## The console/LCL boundary — the only guard is the server build

`tr4wserver` is built by `FullBuild.ps1` as a normal step. **Never suggest
`-SkipServer`**: that build is the only thing holding the boundary. It went
undetected for three days when a `TF` → `uCrashLog` → `Forms` edge dragged the
LCL into a console program, then stayed hidden for six more behind `-SkipServer`.

The fix was to split `uCrashLog`: the RTL reporter links anywhere, and the two
statements needing a widget set live in `src/ui/lcl/uCrashLogLCL.pas`. **A
`{$IFDEF FPC}` cannot help here** — it asks which *compiler* when the question is
which *program* has a widget set. Only the unit graph can answer that.

Note `Get-SearchPaths.ps1` now **does** give the server LCL paths (`uServerForm`
lives there), so the search path is no longer the guard it once was. The build
step is.

## Oracle

```powershell
.\tr4w\build\Build-Server.ps1
.\tr4w\FullBuild.ps1            # never -SkipServer
```

Real multi-op behaviour is bench-only — two machines, or it is unproven.

`tr4wserver.ini` belongs to a different program and is out of scope for the JSON
settings work.

## Coordinate with

`log-database` (row-level sync is the destination) · `contest-scoring` (dupes,
mults and serial lockout cross the link) · `lcl-ui` (`uServerLogForm`) ·
`build-release` (the server is a separate build target).
