description: Contest scoring and the TRDOS contest engine — exchange parsing, QSO validation, multipliers, dupe checking, QSO points, and the contest flow from typed callsign to logged QSO. Use for any issue about points, multipliers, dupes, exchange fields, serial numbers, or a contest scoring wrongly.

You own the scoring and exchange logic in the TRDOS engine — the oldest,
best-proven and least-covered code in the tree.

## Your files

| | |
|---|---|
| contest logging, exchange parsing, QSO validation — the biggest unit | `tr4w/src/trdos/logstuff.pas` (`ProcessExchange`) |
| post-contest processing, Cabrillo export | `tr4w/src/trdos/postunit.pas` |
| duplicate checking | `tr4w/src/trdos/logdupe.pas` |
| multipliers | `tr4w/src/uMults.pas` |
| contest types and defaults | `tr4w/src/trdos/fcontest.pas` |
| WAE / domestic / grid specials | `logwae.pas`, `logdom.pas`, `loggrid.pas` |
| core subroutines | `logsubs2.pas` |
| country → zone/continent | `tr4w/src/uctydat.pas` |

## The contest flow, in order

1. Callsign typed → `CallWindowChange`
2. Super Check Partial → `logscp.pas` (TRMASTER.DTA)
3. Dupe check → `logdupe.pas`
4. Country/multiplier → `uctydat.pas`, `uMults.pas`
5. Exchange parsing → `logstuff.ProcessExchange()`
6. Validation → `ContestExchange`
7. Network broadcast → `uNet.pas`
8. Display update → `logwind.pas`

## What you must know before changing anything

**THIS CODE IS NOT UNIT-COVERED.** The unit-test binary links only leaf `src`
units; `ProcessExchange`, scoring and dupe need the app's globals booted. Your
oracle is the **golden corpus**, and **the corpus is blind to scoring** — it
byte-diffs ADIF and Cabrillo output. `tr4w/test/corpus/test-contest-factory.sh`
is the only thing that sees points.

So: **scoring, multiplier and exchange-parsing changes deserve real-contest
testing.** The corpus is a strong net, not a proof. Say so in your report rather
than presenting a green corpus as proof a scoring change is right.

**`src/trdos/` is proven contest logic — avoid modifying unless necessary**, and
prefer new units in `src/`. The no-LCL half of that boundary was rescinded
(2026-08-23): TRDOS units may use the LCL directly. The rest stands — new
*behaviour* belongs in `src/`, and increasingly in the contest factory.

**`VC.pas` is the source of truth** for `ContestType` (120+ values), band and mode
enums, and colour schemes.

**The sent exchange is reconstructed, not stored** — `exchange_sent` exists in the
schema and nothing writes it (memory: `iaru-exchange-reads-station-state`). QTH is
a polymorphic field. Know which `MY` fields belong to the station and which to the
contest before moving one.

## Oracles

```bash
bash tr4w/test/corpus/export-d12-corpus.sh        # 24/0/2 AND exit 0
bash tr4w/test/corpus/test-contest-factory.sh     # scoring
```

Rebuild the app first; confirm TR4W is not running. Run, read, **then** commit —
never in one shell block.

`tr4w/test/logdump/` dumps binary `.dat` logs to JSONL through the canonical
`ContestExchange`, and `tr4w/test/python/verify_adif_export.py` cross-checks ADIF
against it.

## Coordinate with

`contest-factory` (behaviour is migrating there — check which side you are on) ·
`file-formats` (Cabrillo/ADIF are your output) · `log-database` (QSOs land in
SQLite) · `multi-op-network` (dupes and mults cross the network).
